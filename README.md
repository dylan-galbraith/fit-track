# FitTrack

Your go-to workout tracking app. Build exercises and routines, and track your progress at the gym, all in the palm of your hand!

FitTrack was built as my final Capstone project at BrainStation. I was given about 10 days to come up with an idea, design it, plan it, and build it. 

## Access

If you would like to try out and use FitTrack, you can go to https://fit-track-capstone.herokuapp.com/ and create a new account.

## Tech-Stack

### Front-End

The front-end of FitTrack was built using React and React-Router. Everything was built using JavaScript and HTML, and styled using SASS/CSS and BEM.

### Back-End

The server for FitTrack was built using Express and Node.js.

FitTrack also has its own database which uses MySQL and Prisma as the ORM.
